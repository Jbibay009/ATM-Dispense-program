# ATM-Dispense-program

In this implementation, ATMDispenseChain class handles the dispensing logic for BPI's ATM system with denominations of 1000, 500, and 100 peso bills. The BPI_Atm class allows users to adjust (hard-coded) an amount and initiates the dispensing process using the Chain of Responsibility pattern.

#This design ensures that the ATM system dispenses cash in the specified denominations according to the requested amount.
